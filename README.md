Stop having to click the redirect URL once clicking on a URL in google calendar

Are you constantly getting Google Calendar Notices like this:

Yeah. I'm over them and so is everyone else. You can clear your cache and it is supposed to stop them. I really don't try to do that as much as possible. So instead I created this extension. I haven't packaged it up for the extension directory because I want to add a few features to it first.  In the mean time, you are welcome to use it and send me feedback if you'd like!

# Instructions to install the extension:

1. Download/Clone this repo. If you don't know how to do that, I've put it in a google drive folder for you here: [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DNqhO2v6_tqij5AFnhCJTikqypXuqhQc/view)

2. After downloading the file, unzip this into a place it will be safe. Use your best judgement. Don't let anyone judge you where you put it.

3. Click the triple dot menu in Chrome. then hover to "More Tools", then click "Extensions" -- See the image below if you need more guidance.

4. Click the box to enable "Developer Mode" (we have to do this because I haven't packaged this extension for release) and then click "Load Unpacked Extension..." -- Again I have a little screenshot below to help if you need it.

5. Navigate to the folder/directory where you unzipped the extension, and click select. See the image below. Sorry PC players will have a somewhat different experience with this. Below is what the commoner on a Mac will see.
